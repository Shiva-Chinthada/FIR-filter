Description: 
A Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter is a type of digital filter widely used in signal processing applications due to its inherent stability and linear phase characteristics. Unlike Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters, FIR filters have a finite duration impulse response that settles to zero in a finite amount of time. This makes them ideal for applications requiring exact linear phase response, which preserves the waveform shape of filtered signals.

FIR filters operate by convolving the input signal with a set of coefficients, which define the filter's characteristics such as cutoff frequency and transition bandwidth. The output at any time is a weighted sum of the current and previous input samples.

In this project, an FIR filter is designed and implemented using Verilog, a hardware description language widely used for digital circuit design. The design focuses on creating an efficient filter architecture that meets the required frequency specifications and can be synthesized onto hardware platforms such as FPGAs or ASICs.

The FIR filter design in Verilog involves defining the filter coefficients, constructing the convolution operation in hardware, and validating the filter's functionality through simulation and testing. This approach demonstrates practical aspects of digital filter design and implementation in hardware, bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and real-world application.
